# node-typescript-starter
Get up and running with node and typescript

## To get started go through the following steps
**(1)** Clone the repo or download the zip file and open it your favourite editor

**(2)** Open a terminal in the root dicectory of the repo and run 
``` yarn  ``` or ``` npm install ``` this will install all the dependencies listed in your ```package.json``` in this case it will install three dev dependencies

**(3)** After installing the dev dependencies, run the script ```yarn watch``` or ```npm run watch``` this will tell the typescript to compile the file in ```src/index.ts```
it compiles every time the file changes

It looks like this after you run the watch script

the compiled code goes into ```dist/index.js``` each time the file has some saved changes and the as well as you can change ```tsconfig.json``` file  accordingly as per your requirements and willingness (this is just my personal preference of tsconfig.json file)

**(4)** Now to run the actual code open a new terminal in the root directory without and make sure you don't close the cuurent terminal int which the typescript is compiling and then run ```yarn dev``` or  ``` npm run dev ``` and this will start nodemon at ```src/index.js``` 

It looks like this after you run the dev script

## There you go!!üòÅüòÅ now you have your node and typescript setup try changing the ``` src/index.ts ``` and nodemon restarts the server and you can see you changes live
